- Grow custom plants: Herb mix, blueberries and soapberries. These require humid planters.

- Dead plants can be harvested to obtain organic waste, useful for craftable plant nutrients.

- Charcoal filter: craftable, renewable counterpart of vanilla purification tablets.

- Produce homemade herbal tea with herb mix and jam using preppared blueberries and soapberries.

- Some difficulty settings that allow you to start with some items, tweak growing times from default to fully realistic, or deactivate man-made materials to force crafting them yourself.
